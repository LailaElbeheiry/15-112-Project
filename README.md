# EEE-ICR
"An extremely exceedingly exceptionally intelligent character recognizer"


A user-friendly program that takes images with handwritten text as input and recognizes the text and saves it in a text file.

How to run:
download all the files in the repository
run trial.py

Restrictions:
Scanned image must be of high quality
Scanned image must only contain lowercase English letters
Scanned image must have as minimal noise in the background as possible
***Failure to meet these requirements will affect the handwritten recognition

Libraries:
In order to run this program, the user needs to have scikit learn library installed. There are other libraries and modules that are used in the code, such as skimage, PIL image, and tkinter, but all of them are either pre-installed with python or with scikit learn.

I would recommend, however, that the user installs sci-kit learn through Anaconda which ensure that all of the other libararies are installed as well.
