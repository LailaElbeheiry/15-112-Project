# 15-112-Project
In the digital era, handwritten documents have become inconvenient.
However, we still run into handwritten documents in our everyday lives.
For this reason, I was motivated to create a computer program that converts handwritten text into computer text files.
Basically, the program will take an image of handwritten text as an input, and returns the text file as an output.
In addition, the user will be able to edit the text file through my program instead of having to open the saved text file.


Libraries:
The major library that I will be using is scikit learn.
I will be using this library for the machine learning part of my algorithm.
Scikit learn has multiple models that can be used to classify objects.
I haven't decided on which model I will be using, but probably either Neural Network model, Nearest Neighbour model, or Ensemble methods.
From scikit learn, I will be importing other libraries that are built in it, such as numpy, and misc.


GUI:
I will use Tklearn library to design the GUI of my program.
The program, as I mentioned, will enable the user to edit their handwritten text after being converted into an electornic one.
The basic editing features will be included, such as changing font color and font size.


Thank you for checking my project description, stay tuned for the real work!
